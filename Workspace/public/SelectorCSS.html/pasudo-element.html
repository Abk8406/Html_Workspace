        Before we get to those positioning tools, though, you should know a bit about text wrapping. By default, when you insert images and other illustration objects into your document, Word applies one of two forms
         of text wrapping: “in line with text” (for images and most other illustration objects
         ) or “in front of text” (for shapes and 3D models). When you set an object’s text wrapping 
         to be in line with text, Word treats the object in question as a text character. If you 
          or paste text before or after the object, it moves along
